            <h2>"Coding with a Toddler in Tow: How I Juggle Mom Life and Learning"</h2>
            <p>When I first decided to learn coding, I knew it wouldnâ€™t be easy. My background in Computer Science
                Engineering helped ease some of the initial challenges,
                but the real test has been balancing coding with being a full-time mom to a very energetic toddler.
                Every day brings new adventures,
                both in motherhood and in my coding journey.

            <h2>Early Mornings and Late Nights are My Best Friends</h2>
            <p>After starting my coding journey, I initially focused on Swift but struggled to find opportunities.
                After hearing about a bootcamp from friends, my husband and I decided I should join the C# Full Stack
                bootcamp,
                where I could apply the logic and knowledge I already had. My day usually starts before sunrise; I've
                found that the early hours,
                when my toddler is still asleep, are the best time for uninterrupted coding.
                In the evenings, my husband takes care of our child, giving me the time I need to complete labs and
                assessments.

            <h2>A Land of Rich Heritage and Culture</h2>
            <p>Dindigul-Tamil Nadu, my homeland, places a strong emphasis on education and learning.
                Growing up in an environment that values knowledge and innovation encouraged me to pursue my academic
                interests diligently.
                Witnessing the growth and impact of technology in my home state motivated me to believe that with
                determination and hard work,
                I could carve out a successful career in IT, even while balancing the responsibilities of motherhood.
